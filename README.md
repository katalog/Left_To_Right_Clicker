# Left_To_Right_Clicker
This app is designed to enhance the experience of reading books on Android devices. It allows users to conveniently move to the next page by simply tapping the left side of the screen (changing the user's left tap behavior to right tap).
When the user clicks, whether on the left or right side, the viewer app will provide seamless page turning for a comfortable reading experience.
